"""
This Python3 script parses a PCAP file and looks for recurring data patterns in TCP or UDP payloads.
These can then be used as signatures while building a custom App-ID.
It works for captures with multiple sessions/segments of the same unknown-tcp or udp traffic.
Intended to be used with context unknown-<req|rsp>-tcp-payload and unknown-<req|rsp>-udp-payload, but strings can be converted to ASCII and used in other contexts.
Requires the library dpkt (https://dpkt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Usage: CustomAppID.py -<client|server> <pcap file>
       -client      analyses client traffic
       -server      analyses server traffic

Caveats:
-Only the first client or server payload in each TCP flow is considered for matching.
-The higher the number of conversations in the PCAP, the more accurate the results will be.
-TCP or UDP traffic in the PCAP must belong exclusively to the application being analysed.
-The script works with TCP-only or UDP-only PCAPs. Mixed protocols will result in unreliable output.
-The script finds repetitions in payloads. It does not verify that the strings found are specific enough not to overlap with
 other unknown TCP/UDP traffic. Always validate your findings.

************ READ ME FIRST ************

This file is divided in four sections.

Section one.   Shows patterns found, ordered by payload length.
               Eg. All payloads with length X have in common pattern Y, etc.

Section two.   If more than one payload length is available, the script will try to find a common pattern across all lengths.
               If a global common pattern is available in section two, this is probably the best candidate for the signature.
               If a common pattern is not available, one should use all the strings found in section one, if possible.

Section three. This is to be used as a last resort if the second section does not show a global common pattern
               AND there are too many payload lengths in the first section.
               The recommended way to use data from section three is to recursively select the longest and most common patterns
               and remove from this file all the payload lengths containing the specified pattern. This will hopefully leave
               just a few payloads. These can be used, together with the patterns initially selected from section three, to
               generate OR conditions.

Counters.      Information on number of datagrams and segments analysed.

Please keep in mind the following caveats:

-Only the first client or server payload in each TCP flow is considered for matching.
-The higher the number of conversations in the PCAP, the more accurate the results will be.
-TCP or UDP traffic in the PCAP must belong exclusively to the application being analysed.
-The script works with TCP-only or UDP-only PCAPs. Mixed protocols will result in unreliable output.
-The script finds repetitions in payloads. It does not verify that the strings found are specific enough not to overlap with
 other unknown TCP/UDP traffic. Always validate your findings.
